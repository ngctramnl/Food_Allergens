# Food Allergens Prediction
## Business task
* Build a model that predicts whether a dish contains allergens or not.

## Data sources
* [Food Ingredients and Allergens Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/food-ingredients-and-allergens) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available by [Laksika Tharmalingam](https://www.kaggle.com/uom190346a)).
* The dataset includes a comprehensive list of allergens found in the food items. These allergens encompass a wide range of ingredients, such as dairy, wheat, nuts (almonds, peanuts, pine nuts), seafood (anchovies, fish, shellfish), grains (oats, rice), animal-based ingredients (chicken, pork), plant-based ingredients (celery, mustard, soybeans), and common ingredients (cocoa, eggs). Additionally, the dataset contains entries where no specific allergens are listed.

## Documentation of the analysis
* Here is the analysis and the how behind my analysis: <https://ngctramnl.github.io/Food_Allergens/>.

## Conclusions
* Food manufacturers can use this analysis as an Allergen Detection Model (whether it contains allergens) and include the allergy advice on the packaging.
* The most important variable is Allergens - the presence of ingredients that might trigger allergies.
